    "* Most of the words generated by the model are proper english words, although there are exceptions at many places. This shows that the model has a good understanding of how letters are combined to form different words. Even though it is very obvious to do for a human, but for a computer model to give a reasonable performance at word formation is itself a huge feat.\n",
    "* There are a few drawbacks as well. One of them is that the model often suggests 'and', both after a comma and a full stop which may be correct in case 1, but is always wrong for case 2. Also some incorrected words are generated as well.\n",
    "* The model has understood the use of inverted quotes and apostrophes quite nicely. All the inverted commas are closed appropriately and succeded by proper endings, such as 'said the king.'.\n",
    "* The model has understood the use of spaces and indentations quite well. After each of the 'said the king' lines, succeding text always begins in the new line, giving the generated text, a clean look.\n",
    "* The model has almost no understanding of the context of the initial seed. The iniital text consists of a cold wet day and how playing is difficult on such a day, but generated text talks about rabbits and turtles (which still seems reasonable), but then  starts a conversation of king which is quite absurd. However results on this are expected to improve once the model is trained on a variety of texts rather than just a single book."
